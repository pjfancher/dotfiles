## Setup As Is
[peej.io](http://peej.io) links to the raw install-remote script.

To install all dot files and plugins: `curl -L peej.io | bash`

> **WARNING: This will overwrite current dotfiles**


## Custom Setup
Replace all dot files in the root directory with your own files and run install.sh.
